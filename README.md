This is Template repo for creating a workspace for a research map for https://airesearchmaps.com

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, we recommend using either [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as your editor.

### Obsidian

After installing Obsidian, (if already installed, click on your vault > Manage vaults) once opened press "Open folder as vault" and select this repository.

### VS Code

After opening the repository, you will be prompted to install the mervin.markdown-formatter extension. Please accept. This is to ensure consistent Markdown formatting.

## Template Rules

- Node directories CANNOT have spaces: use underscores instead (they will be converted back to spaces on the site)
- Each node's content should be in a markdown file named identically to its directory (with a .md extension)
- See `/Root_Node_Example` and its contents for more details on formatting and structuring nodes
